# Project Learning Notes

## Objective
Build a hybrid OCR + Table detection PDF extractor that previews and logs feedback using SQLite.

## Algorithms Tried
- OpenCV line detection
- Tesseract OCR
- TableNet (planned)
- CNN+RNN (planned)

## Challenges
- Poppler PATH issues on Windows
- Poor performance on rotated scans
- Feedback schema design

## Improvements
- Add ML model selector
- Learn from user feedback loop


## Setup
- Directory Structure
-- mkdir -p pdf-structure-ai-extractor/{01_requirements_analysis,02_architecture_design,03_ai_ocr_models,04_computer_vision,05_ml_optimization,06_theory_and_papers,backend,frontend,database,datasets/sample_pdfs,datasets/test_outputs} && cd pdf-structure-ai-extractor && touch README.md setup.md LICENSE .gitignore
 

 # PDF Structure AI Extractor

A complete AI-assisted tool that extracts structured tabular data from government PDF documents using a hybrid of OCR and OpenCV-based table detection, trained and optimized using deep learning.

## üîç Features
- OCR with multilingual support (Tesseract, CRNN)
- Table structure detection using OpenCV + ML heuristics
- Mode selection: OCR-only, Table-only, or Hybrid
- SQLite-based feedback logger for retraining

## üß† Technical Stack
- React + Flask
- Python (cv2, pytesseract, pdf2image, SQLAlchemy)
- TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn
- SQLite, MySQL (optional)
